abstract = {We describe a method for the resummation of leading and next-to-leading large logarithms to all orders in QCD perturbation theory, applicable to e+e− event shape distributions that have the property of exponentiation near the two-jet region. After a general discussion of the conditions for exponentiation and the evaluation of matrix elements and phase space to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, we give details of the application of the method to the thrust and heavy jet mass distributions. We show how the resummed expressions can be matched with known second-order results to obtain improved predictions throughout the whole of phase space, and how to suppress spurious higher-order terms generated by resummation outside the physical region. We also give the necessary ingredients for the improvement of third-order predictions by resummation when they become available.}

abstract = {We calculate the thrust distribution in e+e− annihilation including resummation of leading and next-to-leading logarithms of 1−T to all orders in QCD perturbation theory. This enables us to predict the distribution up to the largest values of T and reduces the renormalization scale dependence relative to the leading order at both large and small T. From a comparison with experimental data, we find Λ(5)MS=200±140 MeV, corresponding to αs(m2z)=0.116±0.012.}

The calculation is done to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy in the resummation of perturbative QCD. We compare the results with the known analytical expressions to the same accuracy in the MS subtraction scheme. They coincide if one defines an improved branching algorithm suitable for Monte Carlo simulation, in which the two-loop running coupling constant and Altarelli-Parisi splitting function are used. Therefore such a simulation can be used to measure ΛMS from these semi-inclusive cross sections. Moreover we show that the same results can also be obtained using the usual one-loop splitting function, provided the scale parameter ΛMC used in the Monte Carlo simulation is related to ΛMS by a computed factor: ΛMC=1.569 ΛMS (for five flavours).}

The cases of deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan annihilation are explicitly considered. A general method to exponentiate leading and next-to-leading logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory is developed. A complete formula for the large N-moments is given and shown to agree with previous two-loop calculations. The resummation procedure suggests how to connect the perturbative and nonperturbative regions. The natural limit within the perturbative phase is shown to be the intrinsic transverse momentum.}

Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.}",

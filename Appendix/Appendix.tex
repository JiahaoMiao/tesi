\section{Equivalence between Laplace weight and Mellin weight in Soft-gluon resummation}
In this appendix, we will show the equivalence between the Laplace weight and Mellin weight in the context of soft-gluon resummation.
The Laplace weight is defined as
\begin{equation}
     \int_0^1 \dd{z} \frac{e^{- N (1-z)} - 1}{1-z}  
\end{equation}
while the Mellin weight is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \int_0^1 \dd{z} \frac{z^N - 1 }{1-z}
\end{equation}

we can show that in the limit $N \to \infty$, the two weights are equivalent, meaning they have the same
approximation in the limite.
